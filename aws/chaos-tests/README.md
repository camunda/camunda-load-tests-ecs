# AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS) — Chaos Tests

This folder contains scripts to run chaos experiments using [AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/what-is.html) against the Camunda benchmark environment.

## Overview

Five experiment types are supported:

### 1. Broker Stop 

Stops a **random Camunda broker** (ECS task) using the FIS `aws:ecs:stop-task` action, causing the ECS service to launch a replacement. This tests the cluster's ability to recover from a broker crash/restart — the most common real-world failure mode. Includes automated pre/post health verification.

### 2. Broker Disconnect

Disconnects a **single Camunda broker** (ECS task) by isolating the subnet where the targeted broker runs. The task keeps running but cannot communicate with other brokers. This tests partition leadership failover while the disconnected broker is still alive. Includes automated pre/post health verification.

### 3. S3 Disconnect

Blocks **S3 traffic** from a single broker's subnet using `aws:network:disrupt-connectivity` with `scope=s3`. The broker can still communicate with other brokers and Aurora, but cannot reach S3. S3 disconnect should trigger shutdown by NodeIdProvider as the lease cannot be acquired anymore. This causes task restarts, but the new tasks should be able to acquire node id and become healthy eventually. Includes automated pre/post health verification.

### 4. S3 Disconnect + Broker Stop (compound failure)

Combines **two simultaneous faults** in a single FIS experiment:
1. **S3 disconnect** — blocks S3 traffic from one broker's subnet (same as experiment #3)
2. **Broker stop** — stops a different broker task via `aws:ecs:stop-task` (ECS replaces it)

Both actions run in parallel. The script selects two brokers in different AZs (when possible). This tests how the cluster handles a compound failure — one broker loses S3 while another crashes. Includes automated pre/post health verification with a 300s recovery timeout.

### 5. AZ Disconnect (broad impact)

Disconnects an **entire Availability Zone** by disrupting network connectivity on all private subnets in that AZ. This affects **all** benchmarks and services running in the AZ. Not recommended for production.

### How network disruption works

When the experiment runs, FIS will:
1. **Clone** the network ACL associated with the target subnet(s)
2. **Add deny rules** to the cloned ACL that block intra-VPC traffic to/from subnets in other AZs
3. **Associate** the cloned ACL (tagged `managedByFIS=true`) with the target subnet(s)
4. After the duration expires, **restore** the original network ACL associations and **delete** the cloned ACLs

This effectively isolates the ECS tasks running in the target subnet(s) from tasks in other AZs.

### Experiment logging

All experiments are logged to CloudWatch Logs (log group: `/fis/chaos-tests` by default). This provides an audit trail of experiment actions, timing, and outcomes. Logs can be viewed in the AWS Console under CloudWatch > Log groups.

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI v2 installed and configured
- `jq` installed (`sudo apt install jq` or `brew install jq`)
- Logged in via AWS SSO as `SystemAdministrator`:
  ```bash
  aws sso login --profile <your-profile>
  ```
- The `stable` and `benchmark` infrastructure must already be deployed (VPC, subnets, ECS cluster)
- Pre/Post verification uses the cluster endpoint to query topology. This endpoint, by default, is only accessible via vpn.

## Quick Start

### One-time setup (run once per AWS account)

```bash
# 1. Create the IAM role that FIS assumes to perform network disruptions
./setup/01-setup-fis-experiment-role.sh

# 2. Create the FIS-Admin role that SSO users assume to manage experiments
./setup/02-setup-fis-admin-role.sh
```

### Running a broker stop experiment 

This stops a random broker task, causing ECS to launch a replacement. Tests crash recovery.

```bash
# 1. Assume the FIS-Admin role (required before any FIS commands)
source ./experiments/assume-fis-role.sh

# 2. (Optional) Check cluster health before creating the experiment
./experiments/verify-cluster-health.sh --endpoint <ALB_DNS>

# 3. Create an experiment template targeting a single broker
#    A random broker is selected by default.
#    --prefix: the benchmark prefix (e.g., benchmark1)
./experiments/broker-stop/broker-stop-create.sh --prefix benchmark1

# You can also target a broker in a specific AZ:
./experiments/broker-stop/broker-stop-create.sh --prefix benchmark1 --az eu-west-1b

# 4. Run the experiment (includes pre/post health checks)
./experiments/broker-stop/broker-stop-run.sh --name broker-stop-benchmark1 --endpoint <ALB_DNS> --prefix benchmark1

# The script will:
#   - Verify the cluster is healthy (pre-check)
#   - Run the FIS experiment (stops the broker task)
#   - Wait for ECS to launch a replacement
#   - Verify the cluster recovers (post-check, default 300s timeout)
#   - Print a summary report with PASS/FAIL result

# 5. (Optional) Stop early
./experiments/experiment-stop.sh --id <EXPERIMENT_ID>
```

### Running a broker disconnect experiment

This disconnects a single broker from a specific benchmark, with automated health verification.

```bash
# 1. Assume the FIS-Admin role (required before any FIS commands)
source ./experiments/assume-fis-role.sh

# 2. (Optional) Check cluster health before creating the experiment
./experiments/verify-cluster-health.sh --endpoint <ALB_DNS>

# 3. Create an experiment template targeting a single broker
#    A random broker is selected by default.
#    --prefix:  the benchmark prefix (e.g., benchmark1)
#    --duration: how long the disruption lasts (ISO 8601, e.g., PT10M for 10 minutes)
./experiments/broker-disconnect/broker-disconnect-create.sh --prefix benchmark1 --duration PT10M

# You can also target a broker in a specific AZ:
./experiments/broker-disconnect/broker-disconnect-create.sh --prefix benchmark1 --az eu-west-1b --duration PT10M

# 4. Run the experiment (includes pre/post health checks)
./experiments/broker-disconnect/broker-disconnect-run.sh --name broker-disconnect-benchmark1 --endpoint <ALB_DNS>

# The script will:
#   - Verify the cluster is healthy (pre-check)
#   - Run the experiment and wait for completion
#   - Verify the cluster recovers (post-check, default 120s timeout)
#   - Print a summary report with PASS/FAIL result

# 5. (Optional) Stop early
./experiments/experiment-stop.sh --id <EXPERIMENT_ID>
```

### Running an S3 disconnect experiment

This blocks S3 traffic from a single broker's subnet. The broker can still talk to other brokers and Aurora, but cannot reach S3.

```bash
# 1. Assume the FIS-Admin role (required before any FIS commands)
source ./experiments/assume-fis-role.sh

# 2. (Optional) Check cluster health before creating the experiment
./experiments/verify-cluster-health.sh --endpoint <ALB_DNS>

# 3. Create an experiment template targeting a single broker's S3 access
#    A random broker is selected by default.
#    --prefix:  the benchmark prefix (e.g., benchmark1)
#    --duration: how long S3 is blocked (ISO 8601, e.g., PT10M for 10 minutes)
./experiments/s3-disconnect/s3-disconnect-create.sh --prefix benchmark1 --duration PT10M

# You can also target a broker in a specific AZ:
./experiments/s3-disconnect/s3-disconnect-create.sh --prefix benchmark1 --az eu-west-1b --duration PT10M

# 4. Run the experiment (includes pre/post health checks)
./experiments/s3-disconnect/s3-disconnect-run.sh --name s3-disconnect-benchmark1 --endpoint <ALB_DNS>

# The script will:
#   - Verify the cluster is healthy (pre-check)
#   - Run the experiment (blocks S3 from the broker's subnet)
#   - Wait for experiment to complete
#   - Verify the cluster recovers (post-check, default 120s timeout)
#   - Print a summary report with PASS/FAIL result

# 5. (Optional) Stop early
./experiments/experiment-stop.sh --id <EXPERIMENT_ID>
```

### Running an S3 disconnect + broker stop experiment (compound failure)

This creates a compound failure scenario: S3 traffic is blocked from one broker's subnet while a different broker is simultaneously stopped. Both actions run **in parallel** to simulate overlapping failures.

```bash
# 1. Assume the FIS-Admin role (required before any FIS commands)
source ./experiments/assume-fis-role.sh

# 2. (Optional) Check cluster health before creating the experiment
./experiments/verify-cluster-health.sh --endpoint <ALB_DNS>

# 3. Create a compound experiment template
#    The script automatically picks two brokers (in different AZs if possible):
#    - Broker A's subnet gets S3 traffic blocked
#    - Broker B gets stopped via aws:ecs:stop-task
#    --prefix:   the benchmark prefix (e.g., benchmark1)
#    --duration: how long the S3 disruption lasts (ISO 8601, e.g., PT10M)
./experiments/s3-disconnect-broker-stop/s3-disconnect-broker-stop-create.sh --prefix benchmark1 --duration PT10M

# 4. Run the experiment (includes pre/post health checks)
./experiments/s3-disconnect-broker-stop/s3-disconnect-broker-stop-run.sh --name s3-disconnect-broker-stop-benchmark1 --endpoint <ALB_DNS>

# The script will:
#   - Verify the cluster is healthy (pre-check)
#   - Run the experiment (both actions start in parallel)
#   - Wait for both actions to complete
#   - Verify the cluster recovers (post-check, default 300s timeout)
#   - Print a summary report showing per-action results

# 5. (Optional) Stop early
./experiments/experiment-stop.sh --id <EXPERIMENT_ID>
```

### Running an AZ disconnect experiment (broad impact)

This disconnects an entire AZ — use with caution as it affects all services in the AZ.

```bash
# 1. Assume the FIS-Admin role (required before any FIS commands)
source ./experiments/assume-fis-role.sh

# 2. Create an experiment template
./experiments/az-disconnect/az-disconnect-create.sh --az eu-west-1b --duration PT10M

# 3. Run the experiment
./experiments/az-disconnect/az-disconnect-run.sh --name 1-az-disconnect-dev

# 4. Monitor the experiment
./experiments/experiment-status.sh --id <EXPERIMENT_ID>

# 5. (Optional) Stop early
./experiments/experiment-stop.sh --id <EXPERIMENT_ID>
```

### Cluster health check (standalone)

You can check cluster health at any time:

```bash
# One-shot health check (topology only)
./experiments/verify-cluster-health.sh --endpoint <ALB_DNS>

# Include ECS service check (desired tasks == running tasks) before topology check
./experiments/verify-cluster-health.sh --endpoint <ALB_DNS> --prefix benchmark1

# Wait up to 120s for the cluster to become healthy
./experiments/verify-cluster-health.sh --endpoint <ALB_DNS> --prefix benchmark1 --wait 120
```

### Return to SSO role

After you're done with FIS commands, unset the assumed role credentials:

```bash
unset AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
```

## Multi-user Support

The setup creates a `FIS-Admin` IAM role with a trust policy that allows **any** `SystemAdministrator` SSO user to assume it. Any team member logged in via SSO as `SystemAdministrator` can:

```bash
source ./experiments/assume-fis-role.sh
```

and then create/run experiments. No per-user setup is required.

## Configuration

All scripts use these defaults (override via environment variables):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AWS_REGION` | `eu-west-1` | AWS region |
| `VPC_NAME` | `camunda-dev-vpc` | VPC name tag to find subnets (AZ disconnect) |
| `ECS_CLUSTER` | `camunda-dev-cluster` | ECS cluster name (broker disconnect) |
| `FIS_EXPERIMENT_ROLE` | `FIS-Experiment-Role` | IAM role FIS assumes |
| `FIS_ADMIN_ROLE` | `FIS-Admin` | IAM role SSO users assume |
| `FIS_LOG_GROUP` | `/fis/chaos-tests` | CloudWatch log group for experiment logs |

## Cleanup

To remove all FIS-related IAM resources:

```bash
./setup/teardown.sh
```

> **Note:** This does not delete experiment templates. Delete those first via:
> ```bash
> source ./experiments/assume-fis-role.sh
> ./experiments/experiment-list.sh
> aws fis delete-experiment-template --id <TEMPLATE_ID> --region eu-west-1
> ```

## Investigated but not implemented: EFS Disconnect

We investigated simulating EFS storage outage for a single broker using AWS FIS. The goal was to block NFS traffic (port 2049) between a broker's ECS task and its EFS mount target, so the broker loses access to its data directory (`/usr/local/camunda/data`) while remaining connected to other brokers, Aurora, and S3.

### What we tried

#### Approach 1: NACL-based disruption via `aws:network:disrupt-connectivity` with `scope=prefix-list`

We created a managed prefix list containing the EFS mount target IPs (as /32 CIDRs) and used the FIS `aws:network:disrupt-connectivity` action with `scope=prefix-list` to add NACL deny rules blocking traffic to those IPs.

**Why it didn't work:** The EFS mount targets are created in the **same private subnets** as the ECS broker tasks (see the orchestration-cluster module's `efs.tf`: `subnet_id = var.vpc_private_subnets[count.index]`). Network ACLs only filter traffic that crosses subnet boundaries. Traffic between two resources in the same subnet (broker → EFS mount target) never passes through the NACL and is therefore never blocked. The experiment executes without error, but the broker can still read and write to EFS.

#### Approach 2: Security group manipulation

We considered revoking the NFS ingress rule (port 2049) from the EFS security group via AWS CLI during the experiment, then restoring it afterward.

**Why we didn't proceed:** Directly manipulating security groups outside of Terraform introduces drift and risk. If the restore step fails (e.g., script crash, credential expiry), the security group would be left in a broken state, affecting all brokers — not just the targeted one. This approach was rejected as too fragile for a chaos testing tool.

#### Approach 3: FIS `aws:ecs:task-network-blackhole-port`

FIS offers `aws:ecs:task-network-blackhole-port`, which drops traffic for a specific port at the task level using iptables rules injected via the SSM agent. This would be the ideal approach — targeting port 2049 (NFS) egress on a specific broker task.

**Why we didn't proceed:** This action requires significant changes to the upstream ECS task definition in the `camunda/camunda-deployment-references` orchestration-cluster module:

- `pidMode` must be set to `"task"` in the task definition
- `enableFaultInjection` must be set to `true` in the task definition
- An SSM agent sidecar container must be added to the task definition
- For Fargate, `useEcsFaultInjectionEndpoints` must be set to `true`
- ECS Exec must be disabled during experiments
- Additional IAM permissions are needed (task role, managed instance role, experiment role)

These are non-trivial changes to the production task definition and were out of scope for the chaos testing scripts.
